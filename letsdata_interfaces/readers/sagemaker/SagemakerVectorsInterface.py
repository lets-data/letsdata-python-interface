   * The document that is read from the read destination might have some fields that need vectorization while others are probably identifiers that do not need vectorization.
   * This interface is where you tell on the parts of the documents that need vectorization.
   *
   * For example, the following document for a html page might need vectorization on the text fields but can skip fields such as id, url etc.
   *      {
   *          "id": "318792f5-8bcb-4a77-b362-087520efb49c",

   * 	        "docText": "Article: US inflation means families are spending more than two years ago. The typical American household spent more in July than they did two years ago to buy the same goods and services, according to recent surveys. That figure underscores the cumulative impact high inflation has had on consumer finances — even as price growth has cooled considerably in recent months."
   *      }
   *
   * The extract function will return only the fields that need vectorization with friendly names that can be used to identify different vectors. Here is an example output:
